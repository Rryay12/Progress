                Hello my name is Rona Sando and I am a person in Hiroo Gakuen High School. My goal is to take over the planet using pizzas and cake. 
                I hope you enjoy my existance and the fact that i am a great human being. I absolutely hate being in school, not that I don't like studying
                but because it feels so constraining and not fun.
